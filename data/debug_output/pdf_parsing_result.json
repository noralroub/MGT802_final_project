Safety was also assessed. CME\nRESULTS at NEJM.org\nA total of 17,604 patients were enrolled; 8803 were assigned to receive semaglutide\nand 8801 to receive placebo. The mean (\u00b1SD) duration of exposure to semaglutide\nor placebo was 34.2\u00b113.7 months, and the mean duration of follow-up was\n39.8\u00b19.4 months. A primary cardiovascular end-point event occurred in 569 of the\n8803 patients (6.5%) in the semaglutide group and in 701 of the 8801 patients\n(8.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to\n0.90; P<0.001). Adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of the trial\nproduct occurred in 1461 patients (16.6%) in the semaglutide group and 718 pa-\ntients (8.2%) in the placebo group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and overweight or obesity but\nwithout diabetes, weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg was supe-\nrior to placebo in reducing the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes,\nnonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke at a mean follow-up of 39.8\nmonths.
